1. Fill up the blanks:
(a) {} âˆ— =
(b) For any language L, âˆ…L = Lâˆ… =
2. Let L be a language defined over an alphabet Î£. Define L + = LL âˆ— . Under what conditions
will L + = L âˆ— âˆ’ {}?
3. Let Î£ be an alphabet. Answer the following questions with formal justification:
(a) Is every language defined over Î£ countable?
(b) Is the set of all languages defined over Î£ countable?
4. Consider the graph shown below on the right and answer the following questions.
(a) Give a suitable alphabet of your choice and represent the graph
as a string.
a
(b) Represent the graph as a string in binary alphabet {0, 1}. Pro-
vide details to interpret your binary encoding.
c
d
b
5. Let Î£ 1 and Î£ 2 be two disjoint alphabets. Is it always possible to define a one-to-one function
(w)|
T : Î£ 1 âˆ— â†’ Î£ 2 âˆ— . If yes, what is maximum value of |T |w|
? (You also need to consider the case
in which Î£ 1 or Î£ 2 is unary.)
6. Recall that a finite state machine is a 5-tuple (Q, Î£, Î´, q 0 , F ). For example, an automata that
accepts a string with one or more 1s is
({q 1 , q 2 }, {0, 1}, {(q 1 , 0, q 1 ), (q 1 , 1, q 2 ), (q 2 , 0, q 1 ), (q 2 , 1, q 2 )}, {q 2 }).
Consider the above description as a string over an appropriate alphabet. Is it possible to
design a DFA that accepts a string if and only if it is a valid description of a DFA? How
about designing a PDA/Turing machine that accepts only valid description of a DFA?
